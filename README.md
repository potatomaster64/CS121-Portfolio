**OOP CONCEPTS**

| Object | Definition |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Encapsulation | Bundling the data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. This restricts direct access to certain components and provides controlled access through getters and setters. This promotes data security. |
| Abstraction | Shows only the essential details of an object in the implimentation. This promotes simplicity and allows you to work with high-level concepts without fretting the low-level details. |
| Inheritance | Allows a child class to get properties and methods from a parent class |
| Polymorphism | Allows methods to have different behaviors based upon the object that calls them |
